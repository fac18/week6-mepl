## The fastest brain-storming ever! 

![](https://i.imgur.com/svorqsn.jpg =400x)
We had a few ideas, we were all set on having a site that would calculate your life span based on your life choices for some time. Though, this idea was vetoed because we realised that using sql to create this site would be redundant and thought it best to go for an idea which better fit the specification for the week.

We decided to run with our 2nd idea, inspired by the FaC fruit basket. An online shop of sorts where you could buy fruit. 
Our customers would start off with a certain amount of money in their kitty and hopefully spend it all on the fruit available in our database.

## User stories

We sketched out what our user stories would be and also made sure to add these as issues. As you can see this sketch refers to the idea we didn't actually end up going with and when we had decided on the fruit basket we were mid-flow. We all reached a good verbal understanding of what we were doing and made sure to alter our existing issues.

## Architecture sketch

We made a quick sketch to make sure that every member of our team understood how information would flow through our project as well as being a brief overview of how our rough file architecture might be laid out.

... we changed our minds

---

The database schemas ended up being more difficult than we initially thought and wasn't ideal for fulfilling the project criteria. So we had to rethink our great idea.

### Current outstanding problems: 

- unable to update database with user input
- unable to retrieve shop data from database
- yet to release website to host on heroku

### Things we have achieved

- deployed database to heroku 
- great CSS! 
- user knows they've logged in
- test! 
- we did a lot of learning!
